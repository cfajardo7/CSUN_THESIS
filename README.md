# CSUN_THESIS
## Hello and Welcome!
Thank you for joining my masters thesis repo! Here you will find all of the madness that is my thesis. As I make my way through my thesis at California State University, I will be slowly adding things into this repository. Those things could be anything from data I have collected to any writing I am currently working on. Mostly, I have anything R related here. I am all about reproducible and transparent data so everthing I do in R will go here. My information is divided into three main folder which are:
1. [Data](https://github.com/cfajardo7/CSUN_THESIS/tree/main/Data)
2. [Output](https://github.com/cfajardo7/CSUN_THESIS/tree/main/Output)
3. [Script](https://github.com/cfajardo7/CSUN_THESIS/tree/main/Script)

The **Data** folder holds all of the CSV sheets that I created using excel where you can find all my RAW data. I also have csv sheets that I created in R.

The **Output** folder holds all and any output that is made in R. That can include any graphs that were made in R.

The **Script** folder hold all of the different scripts I have made and are currently working on. If you would like to download and use my script, please feel free to do so. I just ask that you don't PUSH anything through as these scripts are my work that I have cried and bled for (figuratively speaking of course).
Feel free to browse through. I hope anything here is of some use to you!
